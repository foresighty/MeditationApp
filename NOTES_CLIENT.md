# Mediation App

## Points of discussion

### App Specific Questions / Concerns

- To clarify the app purpose: The App is essentially a mediation timer. However, there is the additional component of purchasable videos?

- The Timer: What are important features and options of a meditation timer? Settings, etc? Review the existing apps.

- Is this conecting to a larger website for course content? Do the videos which have been purchased, need to be accessible in both the website and the mobile app? If so, they need to share access to a common database - can use same login credentials

- Is there a social aspect? What is imagined in this regard? What can users do?

### App Logistical Questions / Concerns

- Pricing: Is the app itself free, and then the videos have a cost?

  - If this is the case, what is available to a non-authenticated user? Perhaps without internet connection?

- Pricing: Does each video have a price, or, is it one fee to access all videos?

### Business Logistics / Concerns

- Best way to contact David with questions? Phone, email, text?

- We must establish **what is** considered **complete**. How shall we define that the project is done? What is included, and what is **not** included.

- Because payment is being accepted, do we need someone to write a user agreement, or privacy statements?

- How to handle the costs?

  - backend hosting
  - database hosting
  - Apple Developer fees for publishing app = \$99 USD + tax
  - audio
  - images
  - others?

- Administration. Handling account access for after the project is complete and passed on.

- Will a graphic designer be needed at any point? Logo, graphics, website layout, etc.

## Proposal

If both a website and mobile app are required, I might wish to do both. However, this would definitely benefit from a designer of some sort. Someone to come up with at least the basic look of the site.

An 'AGILE' methodology makes sense.

- Outline the main objectives of the app

  - timer
  - video course purchases and viewing
  - social platform?

- Setup a timeline for the project as a whole to be done
- Have 2-week spurts to implement features.
- Meet up at the end of each 2-week period. See progress, and determine the next set of features to develop in order of priority. This order of priority may change with time.
  - for example, first 2-weeks: Chuck gets the meditation part of the app working - timer, UI, etc. Meanwhile, a designer is sourced, or examples are found for the website layout, and website sections figured out (Homepage, courses, about David, contact, etc)
  - next 2-weeks. Chuck works towards authentication of users and database structure. Getting authenticated access to parts of the app like videos, etc.
  - next, move to developing the website.
  - get website authentication into place - courses, etc.
  - revisit the social aspect.

Determine a point to call version 1.0.0 complete, and have a live deployment. (üòÉ üçº Baby is coming around March 19!)
