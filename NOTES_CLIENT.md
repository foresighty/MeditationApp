# Mediation App

## Points of discussion

### App Specific Questions / Concerns

- To clarify the app purpose: The App is essentially a mediation timer. However, there is the additional component of purchasable videos?

- The Timer: What are important features and options of a meditation timer? Settings, etc? Review the existing apps.

- Is this conecting to a larger website for course content? Do the videos which have been purchased, need to be accessible in both the website and the mobile app? If so, they need to share access to a common database - can use same login credentials

- Is there a social aspect? What is imagined in this regard? What can users do?

### App Logistical Questions / Concerns

- Pricing: Is the app itself free, and then the videos have a cost?

  - If this is the case, what is available to a non-authenticated user? Perhaps without internet connection?

- Pricing: Does each video have a price, or, is it one fee to access all videos?

### Business Logistics / Concerns

- We must establish **what is** considered **complete**. How shall we define that the project is done? What is included, and what is **not** included.

- Because payment is being accepted, do we need someone to write a user agreement, or privacy statements?

- How to handle the costs?

  - backend hosting
  - database hosting
  - Apple Developer fees for publishing app = \$99 USD + tax
  - audio
  - images
  - others?

- Administration. Handling account access for after the project is complete and passed on.

- Will a graphic designer be needed at any point? Logo, graphics, website layout, etc.

## Proposal

If both a website and mobile app are required, I might wish to do both. However, this would definitely benefit from a designer of some sort. Someone to come up with at least the basic look of the site.
